# CSE15L Lab Reports 3

**Command-Line Opitions**<br>
In this lab report, I will demonstrate `less` command with its command-line options. The path of the file I used is `written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/IntroFrance.txt`.<br>

The `less` command can show the content of a file in the terminal. With differnet options, it can help users to navigate the content of a file in different ways.<br>



**Part 1 less -N**<br>
